			<h3>Ideas:</h3>
			<h5><p>This page has ideas for what to do when you are bored and just in general!</p></h5>
			<ul style = "padding:20px font-size: 11px">
				<li><b>Keep up with school work</b> so when you go back you can still recall lessons. I recomend the Summer Bridges Activity book</li>
				<li><b>Help around the house!</b>It takes a lot less screaming from your parents and it spends time!</li>
				<li><b> Limit Screen Time.</b> If you are doing online schooling, there is no need to worsen your eyesight by adding to the too-much-sceen-time you already have</li>
				<li><b>Clean around the house!!</b>It takes a huge chunk of boredom out of your day and you feel good afterword too.</li>
				<li><b> Start a project.</b> You wiil have something to look foreword to and it will cure boredom. Exaples of projects are painting, programming something for fun, fun science experiments, etc. </li>
				<li><b>Learn a new language!</b>It's so fun!</li>
				<li><b>Talk to your parents about your family history.</b>It will really fasinate you.</li>
				<li><b>Read!</b>Open yourself to a world of possibilities like fantasy. Settle somthing you can rely on like non-fiction. Make a connection with realistic fiction books. Understand others through biographies.</li>
				<li><b>Play outside.</b>Vitamin D is very good for you and you need to socialize with others. It is what define humans!<i>*Be sure to maintain at least 6 feet in social distance and wear a face mask*</i></li>
				<li><b>Stay in touch with friends!</b>It feels good.</li>
